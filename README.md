## Notes on branching and repository layout

* All development branches (and subsequent Pull Requests) should be carried out on the 'develop' branch. This enables code to be run into the 'vNext' IAT and E2E environments. The 'main' branch forms the route to live, and 'develop' is merged to 'main' accordingly as releases are planned.
